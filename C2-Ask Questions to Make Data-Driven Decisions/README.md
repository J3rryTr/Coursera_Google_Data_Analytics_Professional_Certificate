		- Six common problem types:  
			1. Making predictions: using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future.   
			2. Categorizing things: different groups or clusters based on common features.   
			3. Spotting something unusual: data analysts identify data that is different from the norm.   
			4. Identifying themes: takes categorization as a step further by grouping information into broader concepts.  
			5. Discovering connections: data analysts to find similar challenges faced by different entities, and then combine data and insights to address them.   
			6. Finding patterns: Data analysts use data to find patterns by using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again.

			3. Action-oriented: questions help you get there.--> make easier understand a problem  
			4. Relevant: questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve.--> give a detail of questions to solve   
			5. Time-bound: questions specify the time to be studied.--> limits the range of possibilities and enables the data analyst to focus on relevant data.
